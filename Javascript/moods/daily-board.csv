**Demi 🦖 - Slice-a-palooza workshop**

Alistair Cockburn Elephant Carpaccio concept
Horizontal Slicing:

- Divide work based on architectual layers
  Vertical ""Cake"" Slicing
- Each story cuts through all the layers or components
- Every slice adds visible value
- constant re-factoring
- Co-requisite of awesome:
  - Continuous integration
  - Continuos Delivery

Neil Killick - Heirarchy of slicing mehtods
Capability Slice:

- Whole products -> epics & adaptable roadmaps
- Great for BIG PICTURE visualising

Functional Slice:

- Epics -> Stories in a narrative
- Great for flows, journeys, experiences

Implementations Slice:

- Big stories -> Small stories -> Tasks
- Great for actual implementation

## TIL

In the context of Docker: if a layer is updated, then everything after that layer will also be updated. To optimise, put commands that are unlikely to update at the start of the file.

## What we did…

**REDUX**

- Building counter.
- Slice contains certain reducers and states for a specific feature.
- Local state vs global state
  - Local state → only be accessed inside the component
  - Global state → can be accessed anywhere within the app
- `Provider`
  - In order for the states inside `store` object to be accessed within the app, we need to use `Provider` at `index.js`.
- `configureStore`
- `useDispatch`
- `useSelector`
- `createSlice`
  - It returns an object looks like this:
  - ```
    {
        name : string,
        reducer : ReducerFunction,
        actions : Record<string, ActionCreator>,
        caseReducers: Record<string, CaseReducer>.
        getInitialState: () => State
    }
    ```
  - …
- `immer` (library)
  - This allows us to freely mutate the state, and it will internally be converted to an immutable version

- Debugged Quizzes app with Hayley:

- Read links from [mentorloop](https://mentorloop.com/blog/ ""‌"") - suggested by Jaime
- **REDUX**
  - State management library or pattern
  - Everything is immutable → You need to make copy of it, then update the copy instead.
  - **Redux terminology:**
    1. `store` : an object
       \- Create `store` variable by using `Redux.createStore(<reducer_name>, {<initial_state_value>})`
       \- All the states are kept inside `store` object
       \- Eg:
       \- \`\``javascript
       var store = Redux.createStore(counter, { count: 0 });
       // more than 1 state
       var store = Redux.createStore(counter, { count: 0, times: 0 });
    ```
    ‌
    ```
    1. Reducer : a function
       \- Receive the current state & action as parameter
       \- Make a copy of the state with the matching action’s `type` and `payload`, then update the state’s value accordingly.
       \- The return value of the reducer function will be passed to `dispatcher`.
    2. Event
       \- i.e. deposit $10 or withdraw $10
       \- Event will be transformed into an action
    3. Actions : an object
       \- `type` : description of the action
       \- Convention format is `domain/EVENTNAME`:
       \- `domain` → the feature or category that the action belongs to
       \- `EVENTNAME` → the specific thing that happened
    ```
    - `payload` (optional) : the additional info about what happened.
    ```
    1. Dispatcher : Redux magic
       \- It’s the only way you can update the state value is to call `store.dispatch(<action>)` and pass in an `action` object.
       \- Then it will run the reducer function and save the new state value inside.
    2. Selector (optional) : a function
       \- A getter function → only to get a thing (or state) you want from the `store` object and return it.
    3. `getState()`
       \- `store.getState()` to retrieve the updated state value.
    4. `store.subscribe()`
       \- If the state changes, it will trigger the `render()` function.

**Demi 🦖**

- Worked on card
  - rspec did not pass however felt like I hit a wall with looking so put up the PR for feedback for help.
  - Awaiting review from team
- Redux learning:
  - library for managing application state - and pattern - it is a way of approaching managing state
    - State = anything you want to keep track of that you don't want to loose
    - Anywhere can access state from the Redux library as opposed to reaching for the changed states in a component
    - Everything is immutable
  - `Store`: (object) - when you create a store initial state and a reducer (reducer has to take a current state and an action) store must contain a reducer when initialised
    - `Dispatcher` - the only way to update state is to go through a dispatcher. Takes the action object and determines which reducer  (Redux magical land)
    - `Reducer` - takes current state and action, makes a copy of state and update the copy with the new information. Goes back to dispatcher and updates store to change `store`
    - `State` - immutable must be made as a copy to be changed to keep history

    // create a type
    type AddTwoNumbersArgs = {
    	first: number;
    	second: number;

    export const addTwoNumbers = (params: AddTwoNumbersArgs ) => {
    	return params.first + params.second;
    };

    // inline types
    export const addTwoNumbers = (params { first: number; second: number } ) => {
    	return params.first + params.second;
    };

    it(""Should add the two numbers together"", () => {
    	expect(
    		addTwoNumbers({
    			first: 2,
    			second: 4,
    		}),
    	).toEqual(6);

    	expect(
    		addTwoNumbers({
    			first: 10,
    			second: 20,
    		}),
    	).toEqual(30);
    });
    ```
  - Interface will provide better error explanations ie. `""Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to type 'AddTwoNumbers Args'""`
  - ‌
  - ```javascript
    import { expect, it } from ""vitest"";

    // adding in a '?' before the colon
    export const getName = (params: { first: string; last?: string }) => {
    	if (params.last) {
    		return '${params.first} ${params.last}';
    	}
    	return params.first;
    };

    it(""Should work with just the first name"", () => {
    	const name = getName({
    		first: ""Matt"",
    	});

    expect(name).toEqual(""Matt"");
    });

    it(""Should work with the first and last name"", () => {
    	const name = getName({
    		first: ""Matt"",
    		last: ""Pocock"",
    	});
    	
    expect(name).toEqual(""Matt Pocock"");
    });
    ```
  - The `?` will create an or `|` option on the property and make the type `string | undefined` you can then choose whether to use the property or not
    You can put `string | undefined` inline after the colon of the property however you will still need to use the property it is still not optional

    - With this `reference`, it adds a foreign key pointing to the `tags` table from `destinations` table.
    - Basically referring where is the primary key i think…
  - To rebuild database structure:
    - ```
      rake db:drop:all
      rake db:create:all
      rake db:migrate
      ```
    - …
  - `image_tag` helper method in rails
    - `<%= image_tag tag.image %>` : (tag is the row in Tag model)
    - another e.g: `<%= image_tag destination.image %>`
  - `<name>_path(<row_name>)`:
    - Under your route, you can use `as:` name the route, need to use symbol.
      - Eg:
        - ```
          get '/tags/:id', to: 'tags#show', as: :tag
          ```
    - under your erb file, you can `link_to`:
      - ```
        <% @tags.each do |tag| %>
        	<div class=""card col-xs-4"">
        	  <%= image_tag tag.image %>
        	  <h2><%= tag.title %></h2>
        	  <%= link_to ""Learn more"", tag_path(tag) %>
        	</div>
        <% end %>
        ```
      - By using `as:` to name the route as ""`tag`”, Rails automatically creates a helper method named `tag_path`.
        - If you named it as `yeah`, then your helper method named should be `yeah_path`.
- Ruby:
  - In Ruby you can open the existing class - `String` and add new methods to them.
  - Eg:
    - ```
      class String
        def initial
          self[0, 1]
        end
      end
      ```
  - `self` is just referring back to the current object or instance of the class.

🦖 Demi:

- TDD Bookclub
  - Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
  - unit of isolation - the thing that is being tested
  - test runner executes the test
  - JEST - facebook wrote it - more popular framework
    - XUnit(implement the same pattern for testing) + JUnit(in java) inspired
    - It's maintained and supported by Facebook, and used to test react
    - It runs under node
    - It contains a test framework and an assertions library
      Assertions are used to verify your functions in your code (syntactic sugar)
    - Other runners still exist
  - what happened
    under what circumstances
    what you expect the outcome to be
  - ```javascript
    import { doSomething } from './index';

    describe(""A unit test"", () => {
    	it(""called, no params, returns true"", () => {
    		const result = doSomething();

    		expect(result).toBe(true);
    	});
    });


    ```
    ```javascript
    export class SomeClass {
    	invoke() {
    		return true;
    	}
    }
    ```
  - Red - get a failing test - write something that is broken
  - Green - do the simplest thing that gets your test to pass
  - Refactor - refactor until it is good enough (this will shift things around)
  - GOOD TESTS
    - They test the what not the how
    - Are not tied to a specific implementation, they assert on the outcomes of a funcion
    - Do not require huge amounts of state to function
    - Are clear and legible, requiring a minimum amount of ""head compilation""
    - Only test one thing
    - Only assert on the dimensions of one thing
    - Are as clear, if not clearer, than other production code
  - Test what not how - testing the outcome of your SUT not how they reach the conclusion (you should be able to throw out your entire implementation and your test should still pass)
  - Test capabilities not data - Diamond Kata - generate at the top flip it and return it

**TYPESCRIPT SETUP**

- Installed `npm install -g typescript`
- To check TS file:
  - Compile the TS file to JS file : `tsc <ts_filename>` or `tsc -w <ts_filename>`
  - Run the JS file : `node <js_filename>`
- For ESlint to check TS code, install this at the TS project folder level: `npm i -D typescript @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- `.eslintrc`, at your folder level:
  - ```
    {
      ""parser"": ""@typescript-eslint/parser"",
      ""plugins"": [""@typescript-eslint""],
      ""rules"": {
        ""semi"": [""error"", ""never""],
        ""quotes"": [2, ""double""]
      }
    }
    ```
- Under your TS project folder, on VScode, open User Settings (JSON), and put this at the last line or bottom:
  - ```
    ""eslint.validate"": [""typescript"", ""typescriptreact""]
    ```
- `.prettierignore`, at the root of the folder:

## What we did…

**MORNING PAIRING**

- **Why we use Repository Pattern in MyProject?**
  - Short answer: because it is faster!
  - Because we still have data in UserProject & MyCollection. To copy the whole database from the old database to the new one, will take too much because they are HUGEEE.
  - So we have this ProjectRepository to query/access the data from new model and old model, then we pass it to ProjectModel - Neutral Model - to organise the info nicely for us, then only we pass the serialise info back to frontend to display.
  - Neutral Model is just a very simple code - only to pass certain info to frontend. Because frontend still need certain info to display otherwise it will break.
  - The project builder builds the project in memory and pass it to the neutral model and then pass it to the frontend.

    - one-to-many - you dont need a joint table. you link them with foreign key.

    - `ProjectUser` is the joint table here.

## What we did…

**REPOSITORY PATTERN**

- A design pattern in software development that provides a way to manage data access logic in a centralised location.
- Like a bridge between the app code and database.
- The flow in MyProject example:
  - When the user clicked on “bookmark” button on the frontend.
  - Frontend sent the “bookmark this project” request to backend.
  - Backend will trigger the repository code → `update` method → to update the project to be bookmarked.
- Repository (a class) grouping all the access to database or editing database methods/logic all together.
- That way we can separate the logic between database and backend/app.
- Useful link: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-repository-pattern-alper-sara%C3%A7/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-repository-pattern-alper-sara%C3%A7/ ""smartCard-inline"")

‌

**PAIRED WITH TRACE on REPOSITORY PATTERN CODE**

- `project_builder` is to build the new project vs `create_project`
  - storing in disk / db→ create
  - persistence storage (if computer shut down is still there, primary storage) / hard disk → create
  - non-persistence storage secondary (if computer shutdown, you will lose) / memory → build
  - Why we need both?
    - ActiveRecord Model/Object is very heavy weight, it has more than 100 methods
    - Faster performance
    - carry light weight object, save memory or data storage

**EVENT SOURCING WITH HAYLEY**

- Flow:
  - When an item is submitted, it can trigger a few commands, then triggers the respective events.
  - But the events are not processed all at the same time, they are added to the job queue & waiting to be processed.
  - And all these events are sharing the same `aggregate_id`.
  - After an event has been processed, it will send to the respective reactor, then the reactor send it to the next respective event to be processed.
  - The state of the item, is calculated by the projector from all these events outcome.
- `shoebox` repo:
  - There is a command folder - in the command folder we have command and command handler.
  - Also an event folder, to show what data is stored in each individual event.

**MEETING: INTRO OF THE REPOSITORY AND NEUTRAL DOMAIN**

- Proposal form: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTlNLCCAsakIWOynlt6--oRCRHTOnYygQwNWbnrrS3Q/edit#heading=h.e290q3kfnbw2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTlNLCCAsakIWOynlt6--oRCRHTOnYygQwNWbnrrS3Q/edit#heading=h.e290q3kfnbw2 ""smartCard-inline"")
- The element engineering team has to be informed about this change, esp the acquisition & catalogue team because this is implemented in `element-backend`.
- It’s not common to use Repository Pattern in Rails.

- Release form:
  - If the author took a pic of me and want to put it on elements, the author has to get me to sign on the release form to get my consent.

## What we did…

- Went through what we did yesterday for the event sourcing card.
  - Monitored on datagod & rollbar.

‌

**adora** :cherry_blossom:

- **EVENT SOURCING:**
  - In normal CRUD, whenever we want to update something, we will have to delete the previous “state” then update the info.
    eg: John has ABC address, and he wants to update his address to CDE. ABC address will be deleted and lost forever.
  - However, in event sourcing, whenever you want to make a change, you create an event to record the change.
  - The event will be saved in the database.
  - Hence, you will have a sequence of events.
  - Then we use the events to calculate the current application’s state.
    - Usually we have a snapshot of the current state to store in database, because it might take some time for program to calculate all the events to give us the current state.
  - Even when we want to delete some info, we never delete the event, but we create a new event for that, so we never lose any info - we have a full audit log of everything that has happened.
  - The events are the fundamental source of truth.
    **At its most basic, Event Sourcing is:**
  - EVENTS
    - Capture all the info - what changes has made here, what had happened.
    - To transition a system from a state to another
    - Recorded in a chronological order
    - Never to be modified nor deleted
    - Eg: transactions in bank account
  - STREAMS or AGGREGATE
    - Group events relating to the same entity
    - Facilitiate a level of consistency
    - Eg: customer and account in the bank account example. Like customer and their bank account will have special identifier (uuid)
  - PROJECTIONS
    - Sometimes referred as “read model”
    - Derive (obtain from) the current state of the system
    - Tailored for specific use cases
    - User interfaces, reports, APIs
    - Eg: The balance in your bank account.

- Refactored the code as did not pass Rubocop test.
  - Before and after refactoring the code in control flow graph: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMjqJzNk=/?share_link_id=387222444233](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMjqJzNk=/?share_link_id=387222444233 ""smartCard-inline"")
  - `increment` and `counter_increment`
- Fixed the tests as it was not intact.
- Re-tested on production database.
  - Trace mentioned, this step might be reductant because that based on her experience and we ran all the unit tests passed.
  - I did it to build my personal confidence.
- Fixed the Rails Logger (2 variables were re-defined).
- Pushed to staging and sandbox:
  - For content-warehouse, we have staging & sandbox environment:
    - staging is more development
    - sandbox has more production data.
- Need to monitor on Datadog & Rollbar

- Assignment Branch Condition (ABC) Size Metric:

  - Default for rubocop: 15 (8 in total).
  - **Assignments**: anything with `=`, including `result.save!`
  - **Branches (method calls)** : anything that jumps out of the current method - a function call, class method call, or new operator
  - **Conditions**: anything that tests logic `if`, `case`, unary `?`
- Branching statement
  - A type of control statement that allows you to alter the flow of a program's execution based on certain conditions or criteria.
  - Branching statements are essential for creating conditional logic, making decisions, and controlling the flow of your code.
  - Example: if else statement, switch/case statement, return statement
- Cyclomatic Complexity
  - The higher the cyclomatic complexity, the more complex your program is and more paths your program can choose to run.
  - that also means you have to write more tests to cover all possible paths to make sure they are all works.
- How does branching statement and cyclomatic complexity related?
  - Branching statement can affect cyclomatic complexity.
  - the more branching statements, the higher cyclomatic complexity.

**[My Projects] Estimation session + tech debt**

- The team discussed about humane_id and uuid
- what’s wrong with uuid in url?
  - security concern, expose how our item’s uuid
  - uuid is primary key
  - In some cases, sharing internal identifiers cause security and/or privacy issues. Example: Sending user IDs with sales data to Impact Radius could potentially allow affiliates to associate individual purchases with individual people.
    In here: [https://docs.envato.net/architecture-guild/standards/third-party-integration.html](https://docs.envato.net/architecture-guild/standards/third-party-integration.html ""‌"")
    (But the context is 3rd party integration)
- My Project will be a feature for enterprise team

- `FactoryBot`:
  - Factory Bot, originally known as Factory Girl, is a software library for the Ruby programming language that provides factory methods to create test fixtures for automated software testing.
  - Factory Bot will create an `event` instance for us for testing purposes, so we dont have to worry to create it ourselves.
  - Only save temporarily. After the test is done, it will be deleted.
  - you can find it under `content-warehouse-api/spec/factories`
- `shoebox`:
  - The source of truth for all events.
  - All events info are stored in here. They cannot be deleted or modified.
  - A database
  - `distributable_item_saga` → is where the emit event happens (reactor)
- `ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base`
  - Because of this inheritance from ActiveRecord base, it carries a lot of methods that we can use to query the database.
- Testing:
  - Mock is terrible in case you refactor your code in the future.
    - only useful when your testing include “external dependecies”, such as write a file to disk, upload to s3, call an external API
- **Migration should always be an individual PR and merge.**
- Adding index:
  - it’s like adding a hash
  - easy for us to query the db without doing the table scan. Otherwise it’s performance problem.
  - `WHERE` clause -> you should add an index to it, otherwise will do table scan. Anything in WHERE clause, we should add index to it.
  - Pattern in Envato: `index_tablename_on_columnname_and_anotherColumnName`
  - ```
    class CreateDistributabilityStateCount < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
      def change
        create_table :distributability_state_count do |t|
          t.integer :total_count, null: true, default: 0
          t.integer :non_distributable_count, null: true, default: 0
          t.integer :distributable_count, null: true, default: 0
          t.uuid :item_id, null: false
          t.uuid :license_id, null: false
          t.uuid :last_processed_event_uuid, null: false
          t.string :last_processed_event_name, null: false

          # Timestamps
          t.timestamps default: -> { 'now()' }

          t.index [""item_id"", ""license_id""], name: ""index_distributability_state_count_on_item_id_and_license_id""
        end
      end
    end
    ```

## TIL

- full build → run full test
- flaky test → unreliable test, sometimes pass sometimes fail
- Demodulise
- for single item uuid, it can have different license ID because different projects use → **single-use license**

**EVENT SOURCING CARD**

- [https://trello.com/c/1wR8Au1q/862-calculate-unnecessary-distributable-events](https://trello.com/c/1wR8Au1q/862-calculate-unnecessary-distributable-events ""smartCard-inline"")

- Shoesbox: Stores all the events, the source of truth for events.
  - CANNOT be deleted / modified! it’s the source of truth.
- The state of the item → whether or not the item can ebe sold on the storefront.
- Event sourcing is good for high volumn transaction.
- Projection:
  - Projector → noun ; projection → verb ; the person does the work.
  - Projection builds the state of the item.
  - One of the usage of a Projection is to collect all the results from all the individual events, to decide whether the item can be sold on the storefront.
  - Same item can have different projections for different state of the items, they need to be **ISOLATED**.
  - Event_subscrition ID = last event being processed
  - Projection will only be triggered when when there is a result coming from an processed event.
  - Projection is a module/class containing all the methods to access the item for a singular event.
- Adding index:
  - it’s like adding a hash
  - easy for us to query the db without doing the table scan. Otherwise it’s performance problem.
  - `WHERE` clause -> you should add an index to it, otherwise table scan. Anything in WHERE clause, we should add index to it.

**PAIRED WITH JARED/MOYA/MARLEY FOR ADDING NEW MONITOR ON DATADOG / DATA MESH EXPORT STUFF**

- Humane ID / Saleability of Elements items:
  - Each item has a data as its saleability status:
    - Saleability status of Elements items - sold on storefront.
  - Humane ID and Saleability are used interchangeably.

**ELIXIR SESSION WITH TRACE**

- Functional programming language with dynamic type.
- `element-indexer` repo is written in Elixir (the only repo).

**ADORA** :cherry_blossom:

- Paired with Jared for to do the manual testing to insert ""add-ons"" & ""graphic templates"" into curated collection and then testing it on staging.
  - Context: Curated collections: items grouped together across diff items types:
    - Intention of this collection: inspired the users to use items from different types to improve the usage.
    - Ady support these item types: Stock video, photos, video template, sound effect, music.
    - Add to support under curated collections: Add-ons, graphic templates
  - Done: Manual testing and testing on staging on `element-indexer` repo.
  - For every index, it has 2 indexes:
    - green → serve production
    - blue → serve offline
      To rebuild the index, it can take really long time & we don't want to break the production.
      So we will rebuild with the one serve offline, while the one serving production still working.
      Then swapped the green & blue with their purposes.

- Just-in-Time migration vs Big Bang migration
- Frictionless
- Pre-condition check (ruby coding)
- Ping Pong pairing
- Observer effect
- Guard clause
- Edge case: extreme case vs Happy path

    - Getting data from the backend, organise them nicely before sending to needed files/component to use the data.
  - We use custom hook to avoid prop drilling.
- **ADORA** :cherry_blossom: **: PAIRED W JARED FOR UPDATE CURATED COLLECTION DATA**
  - There are more items in the curated collections than the actual curated collections.
  - Jared checked and realised that there is a `deleted_at` column on `user_collection_entries`. If the column value is `null`, means the item has not been deleted, vice versa.
  - When we did yesterday, we did not filter out `deleted_at` = `null`.
  - Spent some time and asked Marley to join us to figure out the order of the items after made query from the db. Need `DESC`

## What we did…

#### Pairing with Jared

Updating existing collections - Curation team want to add some items to existing curated collections
Reading docs to understand the process for updating the
Content warehouse is the source of truth for the assets - DAM is going in place of CW

‌

#### Data Mesh

Using data as a product for the StockQC platform that is used to review assets that are uploaded by authors

The data mesh - treats your business domain’s data as a set of products.
An emphasis is placed on usability for data product customers, and should encourage discoverability and feedback.

The Four principles of Data Mesh are:
\- Domain ownership
\- Data as a product
\- Self-serve data platforms
\- Automated data governance

Data Product - consists of one or more collections of domain-related data along with some important meta information to assist in understanding and integrating with the domain.

There is a function being created to gather information from the data that needs to be sent to the S3 bucket for the data team to use for operational reporting and information
The function updates this information every 24hours to the S3 bucket and is considered new from the time of bookmark in the previous update - (New is determined by the version created at)

## TIL

- Eventually consistent
  - updated at its own time (Envato website is every hour)
- Immediately consistent
  - real time update
- Curated collection
  - generated collections for search results by Envato staff

## What we did…

- First standup with the Delight Squad! 🥳
- First Card- [https://trello.com/c/rCnGYeWI/832-audio-playback-status-sitting-above-tooltips](https://trello.com/c/rCnGYeWI/832-audio-playback-status-sitting-above-tooltips ""smartCard-inline"")
  - Steps:
    - Can I recreate the bug reliably ? Yes
    - If yes, you can then write a failing test to expose the bug failure
    - If no, can’t fix, try harder to make it reproducible
    - Once the test is failing then get the test to pass
  - We wrote the **AS IF** portion from the user’s perspective:
    - GIVEN: setup → every step you/user setup until you meet the bug.
    - WHEN: action → the action by the user, i.e. when user clicks/hovers, where the bug happening.
  - The **TO BE** part is DO WHEN.
  - By looking at the problem, it might be because of `z-index`.
    - More info about `z-index` [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.php ""‌"").
    - `z-index: -1` will be always the most bottom layer.
    - Found there is an element/component having `z-index: 100`, after deleted this, the problem disappeared.

## What we did…

**Card Sizing - Marc**
Large card doesn't really exist because it is too much work for one person
Small card is 1 - 2 dev days
Medium card is 5 dev days
Large card is about 2 weeks

Epic is a card for cards - to track other cards with a list or to do from other cards

Done When - will stipulate what exactly you need to do which will help determine the size of the card
Testing will be a part of the Done When part in the card

Cards will go into a backlog for refinement (inbox) - this is the part that needs to get through for refinement
Prioritizing cards comes from external stakeholders - the people who need the work done

System refining / system upkeep - is refined by the team itself

BAU - is determined by the external stakeholders and what is going to make money or what is immediately affecting the users

How often does it turn into another card from another card - new work can come out of cards which are tagged as `emergent` which came from another situation

you don't work on anything unless you have a card for it / if you're working on something that isn't carded up you should create a card

`emergent` cards aren't to track accountability but more so for workload tracking for the team

Sprint planning will have sprint goals - the most important is to achieve the the goals for the sprint

A sprint shouldn't be fully booked out - if you feel like you have room for 15 cards add in 12 so that there is room for any emergent or stretch goals

**Product Marketing - Lauren**
Involves promoting and positioning the product to the right audience, to make sales. Conversion of sales and subscriber retention. A deep understanding of the target audience.

Driving force behind getting products to market and keeping them there

- Go to market strategies
- Growth strategies
- Market research - internal research team at Envato but will still need 3rd party places for more in depth places
- Product launches
- Brand
- Establishing marketing requirements
- User research

3 sales per year - 2 flash sales (April & August) and 1 Cyber Monday sale (November)

- sales are run to create excitement in the customer base to help in the slower periods, also help to boost YOY profits
- try to capitalise on seasonal sales and trends

market competitor analysis - strategy team - sale perspective mainly for cyber monday

Digital Design - creatives for that particular sale
UX team - anything on site that needs to change internally

- adora 🖤
  - Quizzes app
    - Deleted `Quiz` model by executing this command - `rails destroy model Quiz`
      - NOT the same when dropping the whole db.
    - Was confused the [difference between database and model](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70407212/rails-are-the-model-and-database-the-same#:~:text=The%20model%20is%20the%20Ruby,that%20table%20and%20its%20relationships.&text=The%20database%20is%20where%20data,the%20rest%20of%20the%20application. ""‌""):
      - Model = a table
      - DB = holds a set of tablesss
    - Created 2 tables: `Question` and `Option`.
      - Used `belongs_to` and `has_many` to link both tables together.
        - `Option` belongs to 1 `Question`
        - 1 `Question` has many `Options`
      - Even in the code, you have to put the correct singular or plural form.
    - `t:references :question` under `Option` migration file:
      - [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6242100/what-is-and-examples-of-using-data-type-references](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6242100/what-is-and-examples-of-using-data-type-references ""smartCard-inline"")
      - This will create `question_id` column on the `options` table with the `integer` datatype
    - How to add new column after you built the table?
      - Generate migration:
        - `rails generate migration` AddAnswerToOptions answer:boolean`
        - This will generate a migration file that adds the `answer` column with the boolean data type to the `options` table.
      - Run the migration: `rails db:migrate`
    - How to seed data? [Check notion](https://www.notion.so/Quizzes-3e16289c57cf4b028618b9a8ab20bb81?pvs=4 ""‌""). the code is too long.
      - Basically, you destroy all instances in the table first.
      - Then you seed the data
      - Then print out smth on 'console', to make sure you seeded successfully.
    - How to check what columns does a table have?
      - Enter rails console: `rails console`
      - `Option.columns` → `<table_name>.columns`
    - Created controller and view to render questions & options.
    - Changed to radio.

    - Tamar also showed that some of the tickets that relate to tech issue will be sent to devs team. Lance advised that the tickets will go to the responsible teams, i.e. Author, Aquisition, Catalogue, Subscribe.
    - Tamar also showed that there is a Recurly button on the User Management. Supposed to take to CS team to SSO login page then to the user profile page on Recurly.
      - But it only took her to normal login page, then she had to open the SSO login page herself, open OnePassword, login, go back to the normal login page, and refresh, then only she will see the user profile page on Recurly.

  - Shadowing with Evelyn:
    - Took me through the process of answering emails through Zendesk
    - Worked on a licensing agreement inquiry from a client
    - Without a subscription they can download the asset for free however they will not be able to use it with license
    - Once subscribed all items can be downloaded and get the license when downloaded
    - Download limit is flagged when a client downloads an excessive amount of assets in a small amount of time - download limited for 24hours for investigation
    - User management search through downloads is not the best
    - Also noticed the work around to find the NAME of an author on an asset on elements is not very clear. There is a section down the bottom that has “More by [Author Name] - Copy that name and search it in Market, for the author. There you can look further into the Author and more information on assets
    - Assets can sometimes be created in an outdated version of the software which can cause issues for clients when they are downloading and using with new versions of the software. Advice is to revert back and re-save it.
    - Market has more Author information
  - Notes on Sass today - still feeling a bit stuffy in the head 🤧
    - Once sass is installed you can compile Sass to CCSS by telling sass which file to build from and where to output CSS to.
      - `sass styles/main.scss styles/styles.css --watch`
      - The watch flag tells sass to watch your source files for changes and re-compile CSS at each save
    - Sass has two syntaxes
      - `.scss` is used most commonly which is a superset of CSS - all valid CSS is valid SCSS - mi casa su casa
      - `.sass` is less common and uses indentation as opposed to curly brackets to nest and new line instead of semicolons
    - A variable is a way to store information to reuse throughout your stylesheet. Sass uses the `$` symbol to make something a variable
    - Partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files.
      They are named with a leading underscore, letting Sass know that the file is only a partial file and not to be generated into a CSS file.'
    - Mixins allow a group of CSS rules that are going to be reused throughout the code. Helps keep the Sass DRY. Values can even be passed in.
    - ```none
      @mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) {
        background: $theme;
        box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, .25);
        color: #fff;
      }

      .info {
        @include theme;
      }
      .alert {
        @include theme($theme: DarkRed);

## What we did…

**Sassy** :pear: **for sassy CSS:**

- Diff between scss & sass:
  - scss with `{}` and `;`
  - sass without them → using indentation
- `npm install sass`
- `sass styles/main.scss styles/styles.css --watch`
  - Browser doesn’t know how to read scss so we need compiler to compile it to css.
  - `--watch` → keep compiling whenever the file is saved.
- Look at the files structure:
  - ![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/64dd62773fadf921ed525d6b/attachments/64ddbc3c33bc3dafca4a30ee/download/image.png)
  - Conventionally:
    - `main` for scss
    - and different name for css, i.e. `styles` so we dont confuse ourselves the files scss & css.
    - We link the css file into our `index.html`.
  - `base.scss` →
    - where you put your scss/css
  - `_filename.scss` →
    - conventional file name with `_`
    - Import these files into `main.scss`
- We can use variable in scss:
  - start with `$` & camelCase.
  - Example:
    - ```
      // colours
      $hotpink: #ff00d4;
      // ...

      // shadows
      $pinkSolidShadow: 2px 2px 2px $hotpink;
      // ...

      // fonts
      @import url(""https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Neucha&family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap"");
      $baseFont: ""Roboto"";

      // spacing
      $smallPadding: 10px;
      // ...
      ```
- `@mixin`
  - Has to be put at the top of the file.
  - used it with `@include`

    - Created Quiz model and 2 columns for question and options (array)
  - Trying to see how to seed data.
    - Followed [this article](https://ninjadevel.com/seeding-database-ruby-on-rails/ ""‌"") to seed data.
- Could not push my commit, spent some time to figure this out and asked Raf & Marc for help.
  - It might be the office network “firewall” issue. This [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15589682/ssh-connect-to-host-github-com-port-22-connection-timed-out ""‌"") post helped.
- `rails db:migrate` vs `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
  - `rails db:migrate`:
    - This is the recommended way to run database migrations in modern versions of Rails (5.0 and later).
    - It's a direct command provided by Rails itself.
    - It's more concise and user-friendly.
  - `bundle exec rake db:migrate`:
    - This command uses the `rake` task runner to execute the `db:migrate` task.
    - It's historically been used in Rails applications before Rails 5.0.
    - `bundle exec` is often used to ensure that the migration is executed with the gems specified in your `Gemfile.lock`.
- under `db` folder, I can:
  - check my db schema.
  - check my migration file.
  - seed data.

- Context: Translations for item pages
- Plan: Find the code

## What we did…

- PIR - Elements Payment incident
  - What happened?
    - Payment app was down. Users are unable to subscribe, pay and update their payment details.
    - Engineers couldnt access any of the pages under payment app, when routed to them. the HTML is downloaded.
  - What caused?
    - Buildkite agent was upgraded which resulted in aws-cli updated as well.
    - Changed the behaviour of script that we use in PaymentApp for deployment.
    - Behaviour change - new aws-cli changes the content-type to `binary-octet`. Which results in the page being downloaded instead.
  - How to solve (partially)?
    - Manually updated the content type on a few files/assets.
    - Updated the deploy script to set the correct content-type going forward
  - Next?
    - I think there is still some users cant load the page.
    - Possible cache invalidating at the end of deploy process…?

- Gaston - SEO and GA
  - Google analytics is not the source of truth - used for user interaction metrics that are more indirect
  - It doesn’t show the data that is needed for SEO - Search Console shows better information for SEO
  - Paid and Organic ads - SEO is concerned with organic ads (not the sponsored ads)
  - Average position 3.5 on google search results so either the 3rd link or 4th link to show up in the search results
  - Branded Search - if the brand is in the exact words on the the search terms - here you always want to be in position 1
    Non-Branded Search - suggestions of video, audio, photo related searches
  - Opportunity for SEO depending on what goes through the team - a change you make from the team it can take up to 6 - 12 weeks
  - Inspect URL from [elements.envato.com/[page-name]](http://elements.envato.com/%5Bpage-name%5D ""‌"")
  - When google crawls a page it can see the rendered HTML of the page - you can test the live URL of the URL you have inspected
    It will also show a screenshot of the rendered HTML and what Google can see from the bot
    If the page crawled doesn’t load correctly and there are issues when crawled it will created an issue with the positioning on the search console
  - 9.44m indexed currently - these are qualified to be shown on search result pages
    71m not indexed - this has doubled since may - google gives reasons as to why they are not being indexed - main reason is it has the `noindex` tag in the code which was added

### Envato-com Tech

- [landing-page-cms.envato.net](http://landing-page-cms.envato.net ""‌"") - wordpress - oktao - 1Password (internal use only for Envato staff)
- People use wordpress to create a blog and then they are published to a website - it is then hosted to be served
- Envato uses wordpress as the CMS (Content Management System)
- Script that was allowed to go through the protection and security layer, to crawl the wordpress CMS take screenshots, save them and re-load them in another area to be rendered to the users
- We have a proxy web server between our frontend and wordpress to [landing-page.envato.net](http://landing-page.envato.net ""‌"") /lp-elements/after-effects
- This can make things a lot slower but if we cache with caching headers it will check in cloudflare if there is an existing cache of that URL and serve that if it has been unchanged
- user request → cloudflare → proxy server → [landing-page.envato.net](http://landing-page.envato.net ""‌"") → proxy server → cloudflare → user result
- You can set the Header Settings to serve only to people who are requesting this URL from this country of origin

      - Found it - working on it … 👍
      - Image was only accessible within the `src` file and not in the `public` file when creating a component
        - You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by webpack. You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside** `src`, otherwise webpack won’t see them.
          Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`. Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

  - Paired with Tania
    - 2 ways to write model/database
      - **Normal Ruby OOP code - not recommended**
      - ```
        class Pet
            attr_accessor :flag, :other_attribute, :other_attribute2, :etc...
            validates :flag, presence: true, type: :string
            def initialize(flag, other_attribute)
                @flag = flag
                @other_attribute = other_attribute
            end
        end

        ```
      - **“ActiveRecord” way - recomended** because more powerful and allows developers to interact with the database using Ruby code.
      - ```
        # ---
        class Pet < ActiveRecord::Base # here is singular
            def feed_animal
                #####

## What we did…

- All-hand
- **adora** :cat2:
  - Created a PR for this card. (AHHHH)
    - I forgot to `git pull` from `main` before I created the branch. so I asked ChatGPT how to do git pull the latest update from main to my branch:
      - `git fetch origin`
        - When I’m at my branch, fetch the latest changes from the remote repo → ensure I have the most updated info about the main branch locally.
      - `git merge origin/main`
        - Merge the changes from the main branch to my branch.
      - Now I assumed my branch has the latest update.
  - Learned some basic rails on Codecademy (Tania wasn’t available today) while blindly listening to bookclub.
    - 3 commands to start rails app:
      - `rails new AppName`
      - `bundle install` (like npm install)
      - `rails server` to start server
    - In Rails, the request/response cycle:
      - User’s request is sent to **Rails Router** in `config/routes.rb`
      - Rails Router maps the URL request with the correct **controller & its action** (method) to handle the request.
        - I think you can do some logic / magic stuff in the action before sending back the response to user.
      - Action receives the request and passes to **views**.
      - The **views file** (`.html.erb`)that has the same name as the **action** will be rendered.
      - The **controller** sends back the HTML from the view file to the user.
      - **In brief: request → rails route → controller & action → view → controller → browser.**
    - Things to know:
      - `config/routes.rb`
        - it’s where handling the request and decide which controller & action responsible for that.
      - `app/controller`
        - it’s where decide what to do/ process when received a request. `actions` (methods) live here.
        - i.e. I think it can be processing data. like post new data to database, or render result of some random math calculation on HTML/ERB, just like EJS or Jinja.
      - `app/views`
        - it’s where all your HTML files live.
        - the folder should match with the controller name
        - the file name should match with the action name

- Blockers:
  - We don’t have write access to the envato-com repo
  - when we remove the Quicklinks from the page, are we also removing the whole Quicklinks component from the codebase? ANSWER: remove the whole thing

## What we did…

- CARD
  - Removed the quicklinks from (file path)
  - Found issues with CSS of the footer - no top padding or margins
  - Remove quicklinks component as directed from StandUp
  - Needing to remove Quicklinks from Storybook also - `yarn storybook`
  - Deleted quicklinks folder under `footer`.
  - Tested on storybook.
- Storybook
  - To run storybook on envato website:
    - `yarn frontdoor:storybook`
    - ReadMoreCard → the actual component
    - ReadMoreCard.stories.js → how to use the component
    - `title` → what title display on storybook.
      ANOTHER EXAMPLE:
    - `pill_tabs.js` -> the actual component
    - `pill_tabs.stories.js` -> just an example how to use the component and will be rendered ONLY on storybook.
    - The actual component will be rendered on the website and depends on what props pass in and where it has been used.
- GIT
  - Merge someone’s branch to your own branch:
    - `git merge --no-ff origin/<branch_name>`
  - To reset back to certain commit:

## What we did…

- `useState`:

```
import ""./styles.css"";
import { useState } from ""react"";

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// useState is an Async hook which runs at it's own time and will update when it is finished running the function
  const updateCounter = () => {
    // let newCount = count + 1;
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(count);
// count is the initial state before updated from useState async hook
  };
  return (
    <div className=""App"">
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={updateCounter}>add 1</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

if the state of a value is updated then any components using that states value will re-render.

‌

- `useRef`:

```
import ""./styles.css"";
import { useRef } from ""react"";

export default function App() {
  const countRef = useRef(0);
  const handleClick = () => {
    countRef.current++;
    console.log(`clicked ${countRef.current} times`);
  };
  console.log(`${countRef.current}`);
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>I am button</button>;
}
```

useRef = lets you reference the value that is not used for referencing

update by current

```
import ""./styles.css"";
import { useRef } from ""react"";

export default function App() {
  const nameRef = useRef([]);
  const handleClick = () => {
    const nameHtml = document.getElementById(""name"");
    nameRef.current = [...nameRef.current, nameHtml.value];
  };
  return (
    <>
      <input type=""text"" id=""name"" />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

useRef is for backend history and useState is for frontend display and rendering on a page. useRef will not render on a page.

```
export default function App() {
  const nameRef = useRef([]);
  const inputRef = useRef(); //creating a reference from HTML land to use in React land
  const handleClick = () => {
    const name = inputRef.current.value;
    nameRef.current = [...nameRef.current, name];
    console.log(nameRef.current);
  };
  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} type=""text"" />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

‌

- `useEffect`

3 different ways to use useEffect - runs based on the parameters you give the function

if you don’t give a parameter it will run after every render

if you give it an empty array it will run once

if you give it specific parameters it will run when parameters state changes

```
import ""./styles.css"";
import { useEffect, useState } from ""react"";

export default function App() {
  const [countOne, setCountOne] = useState(0);
  const [countTwo, setCountTwo] = useState(0);
  const [countThree, setCountThree] = useState(0);

  const handleClickOne = () => {
    setCountOne(countOne + 1);
  };

  const handleClickTwo = () => {
    setCountTwo(countTwo + 1);
  };

  const handleClickThree = () => {
    setCountThree(countThree + 1);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(useEffect);
  }, [countTwo]);
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Value One: {countOne}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClickOne}>ONE</button>
      <h1>Value Two: {countTwo}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClickTwo}>TWO</button>
      <h1>Value Three: {countThree}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClickThree}>THREE</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## What we did…

- adora :pig:
  - Indexing:
    - Indexing on database or on Envato side:
      - putting info in our HTML file, like `<title>`, `<hX>`, `alt` in `<img>` or may be `<meta>` .
      - There are also smth like `json-ld` ([here](https://json-ld.org/ ""‌"")) to put more index info in a more structured way.
    - Google indexing a page:
      - Briefly- when a paged is indexed, that means the page will be shown on google search result.
      - Google being aware of that page's content and storing the information in a way that helps offering that page to anyone making a relevant search.
      - Whether that page will be displayed as a result (and in which position) is subject to Google's secret sauce: its ranking algorithm that determines how relevant a page is for that particular search by that particular user.
      - You can [request Google](https://support.google.com/programmable-search/answer/4513925?hl=en#:~:text=When%20Google%20visits%20your%20site,Console%20to%20submit%20indexing%20requests ""‌""). to index your page to be included in search results.
  - Social game with SEO team 🗺️
  - Tried SEO Card - [https://trello.com/c/Yw9lAiTl/263-update-elements-footer-copy-to-match-envatos](https://trello.com/c/Yw9lAiTl/263-update-elements-footer-copy-to-match-envatos ""smartCard-inline"")
    - Found the component and changed it locally in my laptop.
  - Refinement with SEO team:
    - Watched the team modify the cards from backlog so it’s easy for devs to understand the cards when they pick it up. (hope my understanding is correct)
  - Paired with Iain on the Paused User access to cancellation offer page:
    - Problem:
      - Tested a paused user on staging but still cannot access to cancellation offer page.
      - Found this - `Authorization::Helpers::CancellationOffers.can_request?(permissions:)` to be `false` (expected to be `true`).
      - Checked the `can_request?` method: Only if you are an active user, monthly subscriber and never accept cancellation offer before → can request for cancellation offer.
      - we think the `active_subscriber?` part making the paused user could not access to the cancellation offer.
      - There is a comment mentioning team and enterprise account are not granted for the `active_subscriber` role, the purpose of `active_subscriber?` is to exclude team & enterprise, but it also exclude paused user in this case.
    - Potential solution:
      - Thinking to add method to check whether the user is team or enterprise.
      - Adding unit tests to test whether the user is team or enterprise.
    - Moving forward: Iain will take care of the rest.

- Context: Remove the Quicklinks from envato blog and envato website.
- Plan: We found the right component for it and we are planning to delete some stuff today.
- Blockers: No blockers just yet. and hope we will not have for this card.

## What we did…

- Performance Framework and Bonus Program briefing.
- Paired w Ross for Firefox problem:
  - Problem:
    - The Firefox HSTS error is misleading, the underlying cause is that Firefox doesn't trust the Caddy cert
    - Firefox doesn't use the OS certificate trust store, but manages its own
    - since the `.dev` domain is in the HSTS preload list, HTTPS can't be turned off.
  - We tried:
    - Caddy puts its generated root and intermediate certs in `~/Library/Application Support/Caddy/pki/authorities/local/`
      We tried importing the root cert/key into Firefox' trust store, but the key is protected with a password that doesn't seem to be exposed anywhere (Caddy docs don't talk about it).
    - Tried `caddy trust`, `brew services restart caddy` but it did nothing for us.
  - Solution:
    - On Firefox, `about:config` -> `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` change from `false` to `true`. Then, restart Firefox.
    - Documented in [setup doc](https://github.com/envato/elements/wiki/Setting-up-a-development-environment#if-you-are-using-firefox ""‌"").
- Paired with Raf, Hector and Ben to setup envato:
  - Followed this [https://github.com/envato/envato-com](https://github.com/envato/envato-com ""smartCard-inline"")
  - We setup `cms` and `gatsby`.
- 2nd Card- [https://trello.com/c/wDW8uBwV/613-remove-quicklinks-section-from-the-envato-blog-and-wwwenvato-site](https://trello.com/c/wDW8uBwV/613-remove-quicklinks-section-from-the-envato-blog-and-wwwenvato-site ""smartCard-inline"")
  - Found the right component - `envato-com/packages/ui/src/footer/quicklinks/quicklinks.js`

## TIL

- Caddy:
  - a web server that speaks HTTP Protocol.
  - Caddy sits on the front as entry point.
    - Eg: if a user makes request to a page, the request is handled by Caddy to decide where to send this request to, i.e. `backend`, `search`, `storefront`, etc.
  - So you are not talking to Rails directly but talking to Caddy.
  - Ruby on Rail has its web server but it’s not as nice.
  - Another example: nginx
- Static website:
  - not pulling info from database.
  - Will always show the same content unless a dev changed smth in the code.
- `cms` - content management system
  - wordpress, posts are created here and maintain here.
- `gatsby`
  - Gatsby only fetches data from `blog-cms`.
  - It has its own page templates, which are react components, and it uses the data from cms and its own react components to build and display the blog as we see it.
- Docker:
  - Like a container
  - Contains everything you need for an application, like dependencies, libraries, etc.

  - Steps:
    1. Based on the card’s info, we knew this is from storefront.
    2. Started servers.
       \- `element-search` → to get items rendered on storefront.
    3. Made new branch: `apprentices/increase-h1-width-on-listing-pages`
    4. Inspected the title to find keyword to search in codebase.
    5. Utilised the CSS dev tool on Chrome to play with the width → that’s how we knew we found the correct class for it.
    6. Updated on the codebase.
  - `max-width: 100%;` → 100% of the parent’s width.

  - SEO
    - optimising what is on the website and how it performs when people use it
    - google can be considered a user
    - increasing the value of the relationship between the internet and our website
    - Aim to put the best and most meaningful page on google to maximise the chances of conversion
      - meaningful is a keyword on purpose: don’t want to rank on just any page and don’t want any traffic on the site
    - 3.6m pages showing in Google = less than 10% of the pages we have across 6 languages
      - Google has actually indexed 10m pages but still has to choose which ones get shown
    - SEO from search - using user signals (search, clicks, downloads etc) we decide which search page is indexable
    - SEO CMS - recently added templates and tokens, with this optimise an entire category all at once

  - You can turn off and on different features eg. flash sale
  - Flash sale is controlled by two time stamps - start and end
  - `offline_local_settings.yml` change the start and end date of flash sale to 2024 so it has not started yet and will not run with our cypress test
  - Cypress test was failing because it is using the code that has flash sale enabled in staging and that is a sale sign up membership with is not eligible for cancellation offer page to appear
  - Cypress test still failing - possibly because we only tested for `scheduled paused` user not `paused` - Cypress test is checking for `pause` user
  - Created a new unit test to check for paused but not active, and active but scheduled pause
  - Added in
  - ```javascript
    def can_access_cancel_subscription_offer?
          (subscription.active? || subscription.paused?) && !subscription.past_due? && !subscription.in_trial? && !subscription.sale_plan? &&
            !subscription.limited_coupon_plan? &&
            Authorization::Helpers::CancellationOffers.can_request?(permissions:)
        end
    ```
  - Test still failing when state is set to `paused` in the cypress test code - state is being used for a subscription test factory

- Standup notes:
  - Context on the card - Paused/scheduled user does not receive the discount offer page in the cancellation flow, trying to add it in
  - Working on diagrams to work out which components talk to each other to visualize the flow. We will continue to work on these diagrams
  - Our React knowledge is making it a bit sticky, Hayley is here to help us work through it
- Our Card:
  - At `CancelSubscriptionLink.jsx`, we went to `../usePermissionData`. Then we saw this `usePageData<FetchMySubscriptionPageData>`
    - `usePageData` is a custom hook that fetch data from the backend.
    - That’s how we kinda knew this is a backend thing.
  - Then at browser, My Account → Click “Cancel Subscription”:
    - You will get this [Request URL](https://account.elements.envato.dev/data-api/page/subscription-cancellation-offers?path=%2Fsubscription%2Fcancellation-offers&languageCode=en&clientVersion=dev&enrollments=acDRkPbsSg6ejqGlTTHslg%3D0%26Hs_kMEQ9TD2cqM6kf0ZEbw%3D0%26AStKTw_YSD-YANSYnLrXUg%3D2%26bdjTIFXsQUODvNwa2ah_aQ%3D0 ""‌""). From there, you will get `canAccessCancelSubscriptionOffer`
    - Looked this up on `element-backend` : `can_access_cancel_subscription_offer` (changed to snake case because of ruby on rails backend)
    - Found this function:
    - ```
      def can_access_cancel_subscription_offer?
        subscription.active? && !subscription.past_due? && !subscription.in_trial? &&
          !subscription.active_scheduled_pause? && !subscription.sale_plan? &&
          !subscription.limited_coupon_plan? &&
          Authorization::Helpers::CancellationOffers.can_request?(permissions:)
      end
      ```
    - We deleted the `!subscription.active_scheduled_pause?` and it worked!
- Paired with Krasi and Iain - `createContext` and `useContext`:
  - What is Prop Drilling?
    - Data is shared between components by using props.
    - Prop drilling occurs when a parent component passes data down to its children and then those children pass the same data down to their own children and so on.
  - To avoid prop drilling, we can use `createContext` and `useContext`.
  - Brief Overview - `createContext`
    - Create `context` at parent component and use `createContext()` to define the default value.
    - Then whenever you want to use the `context` value, you just wrap the parent component with the `Provider` component and pass in the `value` in the component as prop.
    - If no `value` passed in, the default value you set in `createContext()` will be used.
  - Brief Overview - `useContext`
    - We use `useContext` hook to access the `context` value.
  - More info:
    - [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext ""‌"")
    - [createContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext#createcontext ""‌"")

      It’s because I access the instance variable from the method.
    - Using `attr_reader` will allow me to access the instance variable directly without the `full_name` or `age` method.
    - What `attr_reader` does is:

- Paired with Dave to rebuild [Moody](https://moody-apprentices.netlify.app/ ""‌"") React app:
  - Once created a React app → run `npm install` to install dependencies in `package.json`.
  - `npm start` to start the server.
  - Components:
    - 1 component usually comes with 3 types of file:
      - `.css`
      - `.js`
      - `.test.js`
    - Can only return 1 thing. Therefore if you return 2 `<div>`s, you will get error. Can wrap it within `<></>` ([React Fragment](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment ""‌""))
  - We discussed:
    - What components we need after assessing the Moody website
    - What states we need
      - `class` should not be a state as the component should able to decide whether it wanna apply the class or not.
    - What prop we need in what component.
  - `children` props - passing children as props to child component
  - `onClick` - a reserved keyword in React.
- adora :apple: :cherry_blossom:
  - 3-month review with Hayley and development plan.
  - Read a bit “how to read a book”.
  - Reviewed and recreated the code for the Feedback form shown by Dave yesterday.

- Paired with Dave:
  - Tried to [setup elements](https://github.com/envato/elements/wiki/Setting-up-a-development-environment ""‌"") but failed at storefront - Dave kept getting different errors. Asked for help on Slack.
  - Went through React Feedback Form.
    - used `switch` statement to set different state’s value for the form.
    - Fixed the average rating part - `avg` does not need to be a state.
    - Because the radio part is repetitive, we used loop to tackle this part:
      - To iterate certain number of times:
      - ```
        [...Array(5).keys()]
        // [0,1,2,3,4]

        // in Form component
        {[...Array(5).keys()].map((index) => {
          return (
            <Radio
              name=""foodRating""
              value={index + 1}
              checked={foodRating === index + 1}

- Paired with Mark:
  - Resolved the payment page issue:
    - It was due to Braintree.
    - We setup Braintree by following Setup Braintree - [this guide](https://github.com/envato/elements-backend#setting-up-braintree-for-subscription-payments ""‌"") -added env variables to `.env.development`file.
- Paired with Mark - Review dependabot update:
  - Dependabot handled by Github to look for updates.
    - Review it and check the commit message on Github.
    - The commit message usually is came from the official docs.
    - If the message is “Bug Fixes”, usually the change does not affect much.
    - If the message is “Breaking changes”, then we need to check our codebase/search where we used the updated thing.
      - If only use for `devDependencies`, usually dont need to worry too much cuz the dependencies in `devDependencies` only be used during development.
    - Dependabot will also rebase for you → so all the dependencies are updated to the correct version.
    - We ran into bugs that related to `prettier` & `eslint-plugin-prettier`, and also some bugs related to `prettier` & `flow` syntax in React component.
  - Storybook:
    - Local : `localhost:4000` (need to start server locally)
    - Production: [Link here](https://docs.envato.net/elements-styleguide/main/?path=/docs/elements-account-general-components-plansummarycontainer--docs ""‌"").

Pairing with Mario - **React**:

- Installed React Dev Tools chrome extension.
- Did Todolist in React.
- Component can be written as function or class.
- JSX will be compiled to JS eventually then render on browser.
- props is an object.
- State can only flow down from parent component to child component → 1-way data binding
- `this`:
  - referring to the current object.
  - similar to `self` in Python or Ruby.
  - Example:
  - ```javascript
    class User {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }

      greet() {
        console.log(`hello ${this.name}`);
      }
    }

    const demi = new User(""Demi"");
    const adora = new User(""Adora"");
    ```
  - `adora.greet()` will print “Adora”.
  - BUT: (go to browser and randomly select a HTML element)
    - `$0.onclick = adora.greet` → this will print nothing.
    - Bind method:
      - If order for it to print, we can use `adora.greet.bind(adora)`
- This code:
  - ```javascript
    const handleSubmit = () => {
        setTodo((prevTodo) => [...prevTodo, inputValue]);
        setInputValue("""");
      };
    ```
  - By default, when you use the `setTodo` function, React will replace the previous value of `todo` with the new value you provide.
  - However, if you pass a function as an argument to `setTodo`, React will **remember the previous state value** and **provide it as an argument** to that function.
  - This allows you to safely update the state based on the previous value without worrying about stale (no longer fresh) or outdated values.

  - Redo the TodoList.

Pairing with Mario:

- Continue to work on 2nd card and successfully wrote Cypress test from user visited homepage till the user tried to cancel the subscription.
- Cypress:
  - E2E testing tool
  - Can also be referred as:
    - Feature test
    - Full-stack browser test
    - Full-stack integration test
  - 2 commands:
    - Start the server
    - Then run the E2E test against the server.
    - More info [here](https://github.com/envato/elements-storefront/blob/main/docs/running-tests-guide.md#e2e-test ""‌"").
- `data-test-id:`
  - We give test-id to HTML element because we dont want to break the test if there is any changes to the HTML structure.
  - Usually will take it out when push to production.
- Spent long time to figure out why Prettier not working.
  - Cmd + Shift + P → tick Format on Save
- 2-way data binding:
  - Example:
    - I have 5 unread chats & the notification showing 5.
    - If I open 1 chat, the Notification component will show from 5 to 4.
- 1-way data binding:
  - Data only goes down in React. 1 direction only.

  - Rails follows MVC pattern.
  - Important folders for now:
    - `app` contains controllers, models, views, assets, etc..
    - `config` contains the app’s routes, database and more..
    - `db` contains database schema & database migration.
  - To create a controller called `home` and an action called `index`:
    - `rails generate controller home index`
    - terminal will tell you what are the folders created.
  - `rails routes` will tell you what are the routes you have in your app.
  - the HTML template is under `views/layout/application.html.erb`
  - Create partials, i.e. you want a navbar across all pages:
    - Create a HTML file for your partial.
      - Under `views/home`, create your partial as `_header.html.erb`.
    - Under the HTML template:
      - put `<%= render 'home/header' %>` on where you want your partial to be.

- Gromming/refinement with Tactical team.

**Paired w Mario & Iain:**

- Discussed the card - [https://trello.com/c/d9MAaTu6/5244-pausediscount-update-the-messaging-of-the-discount-flow-to-support-paused-users](https://trello.com/c/d9MAaTu6/5244-pausediscount-update-the-messaging-of-the-discount-flow-to-support-paused-users ""smartCard-inline"")
  - At the moment:
    - If the user is paused or scheduled pause user and they want to cancel the subscription → The cancellation offer **wont** be shown.
  - Done when:
    - If the user is paused or scheduled pause user and they want to cancel the subscription → The cancellation offer **will** be shown.

**Paired w Mario:**

- A few ways to approach this card, but we go with **TESTING**.
  - Cypress
- TDD & BDD:
  - TDD:
    - You write red test first, then you make changes to the code to make it green. i.e. unit testing
  - BDD:
    - High level browser test
    - Example:
    - ![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/64a50971b02c4e8b21d1951f/attachments/64a50d6388dfea1c7b795d0b/download/image.png)
    - Simple example above:
      - You write the flow first
      - Then you tackle each step one at a time:
        - Each step, you may write 1 or more unit test for it.
- Software development pattern
  - A solution to a common problem.
- Credit card test number:
  - Magic credit card: 4111 1111 1111 1111 - this card will pass in development.
  - The Luhn algo → to validate whether a credit card is valid or not.

Pairing w Mario:

- Check what HTTP methos: Network tab → Header → Request method
- You can build a whole website by just using GET request with different endpoints, but WE DONT DO IT:
  - **IDEMPOTENCE:**
    - Repeat smth multiple times, it should only do one/same thing.
    - “Idempotence is **any function that can be executed several times without changing the final result beyond its first iteration**.”
  - Browser request should be idempotence:
    - E.g:
    - ```html
      <a hfre=""items/latest/delete"">Delete the last pic</a>
      ```
    - If you press delete here but the network got interrupt, and you delete again, then you will end up delete 2 pics. **NOT IDEMPOTENCE**
- AJAX request:
  - XHR: We only want the data processed.
  - AJAX request: making request outside the browser/ without clicking nor submitting form nor making full page request.
- SPA - Single-page application
  - It does not render a full page. Once the page is loaded, JS will do the rest.
- Thread in programming:
  - Single thread
  - Multi thread
- Computer:
  - CPU:
    - CPU is to get data, output data, process data.
    - register → fix memory (fix in size)
      - register is where the data is stored.
      - the larger the memory register hole, the slower the things.
    - cache:
      - L1, L2, L3
      - 1 cycle = 1 / 2\_000\_000_000 seconds.
    - But register is way faster than cache
  - [Memory Storage Hierarchy](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos217/lectures/20_Mem_Storage_Hierarchy.pdf ""‌"")
  - Eg: if you want to read a file, the file is normally stored in your SSD (hard drive), then CPU will put the file to RAM, and read from RAM.
    - CPU never read smth from SSD.
  - CPU is not doing many things at once, but CPU does it really fast. CPU switching context A LOT.
    - eg: how can you can speak and also see Mario & Demi on Pop.
    - CPU also has a thing called “interrupt” - An interrupt is **an event that alters the sequence in which the processor executes instructions**.
- Concurrency vs Parallelism
  - JS is concurrency.

Pairing with Mario:

- Load Path - `echo $PATH` , separated by `:`
  - By order
  - Order can be set by zprofile.
  - Load path is a set of directories that the computer will go through by order when you ask for a file or library.
  - ```ruby
    $LOAD_PATH.push(__dir__)
    puts $LOAD_PATH

    # __dir__ shows the absolute path of the current file
    # push is to add the folder path to LOAD_PATH
    ```
- `require`:
  - you only need to require once.
  - Once you `require`, it will become global:
  - eg:
  - ```ruby
    $LOAD_PATH.push(__dir__)

    require 'sub/util'
    require 'three'

    # Under file 'sub/util'
    class Two
      ID = ...
    end

    # Under file 'three'
    puts Two::ID
    ```
    - You dont need to require `sub/util` in file `three`, you will still able to access `Two` class in file `three`.
  - There is another option is `load` but it’s more common to use `require`. If you think you need to use `load`, you prolly wrong.
  - Understand `require`, `require_relative`: [https://github.com/ericmathison/articles/blob/master/understaning-require-in-ruby.md](https://github.com/ericmathison/articles/blob/master/understaning-require-in-ruby.md ""smartCard-inline"")
- Package & Library are used interchangeable:
  - Ruby: GEM
  - JS: npm packages
- Javascript: Named import vs Default import
  - Can use interchangeably
  - Named Import:
  - ```javascript
    // folder: components/Button
    const Button = () => {...}
    const CardImage = () => {...}

    export {Button, CardImage} // export 2 objects

    // -----
    import {Button, CardImage} from './components/Button'
    ```
  - Default Import:
    - If you want to export multiple things, commonly put them in an object then export default the object.
  - ```
    // folder: components/Button
    const Button = () => {...}

    export default Button // export single component

    // -----
    import Button from './components/Button'

    // you can also set whatever name you want in the import
    ```
  - …
- Be diligent when changing code / deleting code.

  - 1-1 with Mario
  - Completed Ruby course on Codecedemy!
    - Public method: `public`
      - Default setting in Ruby
    - Private method: `private`
    - Example:
    - ```ruby
      class Dog
        def initialize(name, breed)
          @name = name
          @breed = breed

      end
      ```
    - `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, `attr_accessor`
    - Modules:
      - Like class, but you cannot create instance nor subclass/child class/ derived class from it.
      - To store methods & constants.
      - Namespacing:
        - e.g: it’s how Ruby does not confuse `Math::PI` and `Circle::PI` cuz they (PI) are from different modules.
        - `::` - Scope resolution operator
      - `require`:
        - require module.
        - Some modules are already present in the interpreter (dont need to `require`)
        - Some modules you need to explicitly `require` it.
      - `include`:
        - Allow instance to use the methods & constants in the module
        - You dont need to prepend the module name.
          - Eg: Since everything has been pulled in, you can simply write `PI` instead of `Math::PI`.
      - `extend`:
        - Whereas `include` mixes a module’s methods in at the instance level (allowing instances of a particular class to use the methods), **the** `extend` keyword mixes a module’s methods at the _class_ level.
        - This means that _class itself_ can use the methods, as opposed to _instances_ of the class.
    - Constants:
      - Ruby’s constants are written in ALL_CAPS.
    - Mixin - combined of Modules & Classes
      - EXAMPLE:
      - ```ruby
        module Action
          def jump
            @distance = rand(4) + 2
            puts ""I jumped forward #{@distance} feet!""
          end
        end

        class Rabbit
          include Action
          attr_reader :name
          def initialize(name)
            @name = name
          end
        end

        class Cricket
          include Action
          attr_reader :name
          def initialize(name)
            @name = name
          end
        end

        peter = Rabbit.new(""Peter"")
        jiminy = Cricket.new(""Jiminy"")

        peter.jump
        jiminy.jump

  - Tool for checking accessibility
    - Lighthouse
    - AXE
  - Should use semantic HTML - HTML tags that have meaning.
  - Should have an alt text for any “image” content.
  - HTML attributes help with the accessibility:
    - `role=""...""`
    - `aria-label`
    - `aria-labelledby`
    - etc…
  - Dev Tool → “Element” tab → “Accessibility” sub-tab
- Always try to understand the error and try to debug.
  - 3 parts of the error:
    - type of the error
    - message of the error
    - trace of the error
- Difference between internet vs WWW:
  - Internet:
    - IP/TCP
  - WWW:
    - HTTP
- Updated elements 5 servers then found why browser kept giving us 500 internal server error:
  - ElasticSearch table was not generate → it could be due to we used homebrew to install previously and now it’s using `asdf` to install.
  - `rake index:prepare` to the rescue. (Rake is task runner in rails)

- :apple: adora :apple: (Paired with Mario)
  - Tested TTT Ruby
  - Methods can do:
    - **query**: return a value
    - **command**: change the state of the system
    - If we have a choice, better to use query even tho it will use a little bit more memory
    - When to use command method?
      - when you want to change smth in the system:
        - Example:
        - ```
          def create_user(name, username)
          # ...
          end

          def send_welcome_email(name, username, email)
          # ...
          end
          ```
  - Testing:
    - Testing should be testing the output you expect or the expected user behaviour, but not your code does.
    - If the test fails, refractor your code.
    - 3 steps:
      - Setup
      - Execution
      - Expectation
    - Mocking → can only do mocking where there is more than 1 object.
  - Ruby:
    - Lambda (similar to proc, more stricter)
    - SYNTAX:
    - ```
      lambda { |param| block }
      ```
    - Diff between proc & lambda (2 only):
      - a lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it, while a proc does not. This means that a lambda will throw an error if you pass it the wrong number of arguments, whereas a proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign `nil` to any that are missing.
      - when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without going back to the calling method.

- :apple: adora :apple:
  - Pairing with Mario.
  - 4 type of variables:
    - global variable - 1 bucket
    - local variables - once the local var reaches the end of the block or method (`end`), the local will be thrown away. Bucket is empty.
    - instance variables - `@`
    - class variables - `@@` - a ‘global’ variable within the class
  - Scoping - global scope vs local scope
  - Ruby normally does not pass in a function as argument to another function.
  - [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/ ""‌""):
    - Major - not backward compatible
    - Minor - intro new features
    - Patch - bug fix / security fix, mostly no new features
  - Literals → when you literally type in the value
    - With the magic comment, if you type literal string, it will add `.freeze` to the string.
      Frozen string → use the same string in same memory everytime so you dont create new string in memory.
  - Memory →
    - RAM anything you will lose when power is off (turn off the power), will be on RAM,
    - hard-drive is on the other hand.
  - Garbish collector → clean up the memory or re-game the memory.
  - Abstraction:
    - The code can be understand without looking at the whole codebase.
  - Made my TTT code abstraction/refractoring

- Retro with Satellite team.
- PIR: Mixkit CORS issue:
  - Reflected the whole process:
    - how did we discover the problem,
    - what have been tried to resolve the problem,

  - Ruby:
    - **Procs**
      - Saved a block to a variable.
      - Use `&` any time we pass a proc to a method that expects a block. (convert proc into a block)
        ```
        cube = Proc.new { |x| x ** 3 }

        [1, 2, 3].collect!(&cube)
        # ==> [1, 8, 27]
        [4, 5, 6].map!(&cube)
        # ==> [64, 125, 216]
        ```
      - Can be reused.
      - Can be called directly by using `.call` method.
      - ```
        hi = Proc.new { puts 'Hello!'}
        hi.call
        # 'Hello!'
        ```
      - We can combine `yield` and `proc`
      - ```
        # create greeter method
        def greeter
          yield
        end

        # create a new procs
        phrase = Proc.new {puts 'Hello there!'}

        # call the greeter method and pass in phrase as argument
        greeter(&phrase)
        ```
    - Difference between procs & blocks
      1. procs is object; block is not object.
      2. You can call / invoke procs; You cannot call / invoke block.
    - `select` method (like `filter` in JS)
      - Example:
      - ```
        [1,2,3,4,5,6].select { |n| n.even? }
         # [2,4,6]
        ```

    - Realised data could mean:
      - customer data: customer profile, purchase history, browser behavior
      - items data: the products
    - Analytics team & Markerting team use data intensively to make decision.
    - Explained what relationship between model:
      - Normalisation - no repeat yourself.
      - Entity = table

  - **Block**:
    - A block of code wrapped around `do`… `end` or `{}`.

  - `public_send` and `send`
    - Invokes the method identified by _symbol_, passing it any arguments specified.
    - When the method is identified by a string, the string is converted to a symbol.
    - But `public_send` only able to access to public methods, whereas `send` access to public & private methods.
  - `respond_to?`
    - check if the method can be received by the object.
    - return boolean value.
  - `methods.sort`
    - will return an array of methods that object access to.
  - In Ruby, methods can have different visibility levels, such as public, private, and protected.
  - `# frozen_string_literal: true`
    - With this, string literal will be frozen and become immutable.
    - Therefore, same strings will be safely reused for performance optimisation.
    - That’s why they will have the same `object_id`.

- Demi 🦖
  - Reading the Well-Grounded Rubyist
    - “Calling a method” = sending a message to a receiving object, object executes the corresponding method (if there is a valid method)
    - Ruby sees all data structures and values as _objects._ Every object is capable of understanding a certain set of messages. Each message that an object understands corresponds directly to a _method._

- Mobbing Session with Dave:
  - Talked about this card: [https://trello.com/c/7h9quFVL/1307-apprentice-task-get-rid-of-size-warning-download-on-mobile-prompt](https://trello.com/c/7h9quFVL/1307-apprentice-task-get-rid-of-size-warning-download-on-mobile-prompt ""smartCard-inline"")
  - Dave showed us the direction how to solve the card.
  - When we first clicked on the button “download…”, the HTML `<div>` element for this modal (pic below) will be added to the document.
  - ![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/6479287d3269107e128eebcb/attachments/647945aa60b5e4ad8a7fb9c3/download/image.png)
  - In this `<div>`, it has the `data-controller` attribute, therefore Stimulus will look for the controller and connect between the controller and the `<div>` element.
  - In the controller file, it has `connect()` function to check if it is a mobile device, if yes, then it turns the `mobile-prompt-value` to `true`, hence trigger the css style → `display: block;`.
  - Once the download is being processed or done, `runDownloadProcess()` will set `mobile-prompt-value` back to `false`.
  - **We can try to:**
    - **remove the** `mobilePrompt` **from the controller file**
    - **remove the** `<div>` **from the html file.**
    - **remove the CSS style relates to** `mobile-prompt-value`

  - Pairing session with Mario:
    - Figured why the `vacancies` method from the hotel_booking exercise will return as an array.
    - If I only put 1 “variable” or placeholder when iterating a hash, it will return as array:
    - ```
      capitals = {australia: ""Canberra"", malaysia: ""KL""}

      capitals.each do |capital|
        puts capital.inspect
      end

      # this will return
      [:australia, ""Canberra""]
      [:malaysia, ""KL""]
      ```
    - If you just wanna use key or just the value, you can use `_` as a empty placeholder:
    - ```
      capitals.each do |key, _|
        puts key
      end

      # this will just return all the keys.
      ```
    - `.keys.each` and `values.each` methods.
    - Different between `p smth...` and `puts smth.inspect`
      - p will return the object you pass in
      - puts will return as `nil`.
  - Tried to understand the code from the card with what Dave explained.

- Retro 🦹
  - We will make sure to keep the daily board up to date and full of detail
  - Hayley will ask recap questions (and we’ll answer them!!) 🫡
  - We’ll all try to be a little more engaged in our morning sync 🎙️
- Git with Mario:
  - sha (`sha256`) - hashing algo:
    - 0-9 and a-f.
    - Regardless of the input length, the hashed will always be the same length.
    - Input takes commit parents, author & commit message.
    - Purpose:
      - To generate uniqueness
      - Integrity check
  - Whenever you merge, you create a new commit. Therefore the tree can be messy.
  - Rebase:
    - Change parents.
    - It will also generate a new commit & have a new commit ID (sha).
    - When rebasing, you might need to resolve conflict multiple times.
    - ![image.png](https://trello.com/1/cards/6473e273c5c24d4eacdf3846/attachments/647445d1fed848460b017a0d/download/image.png)

  - Why we need re-base?
    - In case you accidentally made a mistake on the commit.
    - Or you want to merge main but you don’t want to make the tree weird or messy.
    - But rebase or merge, it’s depends on developer’s preference.
  - **To do rebase**:
    - `git fetch` - only update commits in your local machine/branch. (Can be anywhere in the repo)
    - `git rebase origin/main` - most of the time we rebase `origin/main`. (has to be inside the branch)
    - `git push origin +branch_name`. (has to be inside the branch)
  - Why it’s important to understand the tree?
    - To see the history i.e. why we made the changes? Easy to see the changes in the past.
    - Understand **why** you did this changes.
  - `squash` → meld into previous commit
  - `drop` → delete or reset the commit back to the previous state.
- Hashing:
  - 1-way encrytion.
  - Same input, same output.
  - Slightly different input will cause dramatically different output.
- Sprint planning with Satellites
- Pairing - but found bug then turned into an intense session trying to fix the bug.

  - Reviewed the code from the card we completed today:
    - Problems:
      - Accordion cannot be closed once opened.
      - The link does not work when you “clicked” on the footer title on mobile - because `<label>` sits on top of the link.
    - Accordion part:
      - Changed `radio` to `checkbox` so we can expand & close the accordion. `checkbox` allows select and unselect whereas `radio` doesnt.
    - Link & chevron separated:
      - Removed the position: relative & absolute from  `<h4>` parts cuz we dont need them.
      - Made `<h4>` becomes flex so its children can be align horizontally (default) & added `align-item: center` (Items align at the vertical center of the container.)
      - Moved the chevron to `<label>` cuz there is where we want the chevron attachs to trigger the functionality of `<input type=""checkbox"">`.
      - Adjusted `margin-bottom` to `<label>` so the chevron and the footer title are in same line.
      - Changed the class name to the `<label>` class name for the transition to be triggered.
  - **GIT**: To add new changes to the previous commit
    - Add the change to staging area first.
    - `git commit --amend` → add your staging change to the previous commit.
    - VS code pop out → if write any commit msg here (top), will overwrite the previous commit msg.
    - `git push origin +your_branch_name` → push forcefully to your remote branch.

- Satellites refinement (sprint planning)
- Dave helped with [Fix Footer UX bugs on mobile card](https://trello.com/c/q7r1VCCf/1317-apprentice-task-fix-footer-ux-bugs-on-mobile ""‌"") fixing the footer’s accordion part
  - Dave showed us 2 different ways:
    - Either change the input type from `radio` to `checbox`.
    - Or do it in Stimulus JS way:
      - Link the JS file to the footer html file.
      - Remove the input tag.
      - Add this to the label tag as attribute: `data-action=""click->global--footer#toggleDropDown""`
      - Add this to the JS file:
      - ```
          toggleDropDown(event){
            const parentColumn = event.target.closest("".global-footer-link-column"")
            parentColumn.classList.toggle(""global-footer-link-column--open"")
          }
        ```
      - Then change on the scss file.
- More on the **Stimulus JS** part:
  - Stimulus → Single-page application, allowing us to use vanilla JS.
  - This runs when page is loaded:
  - ```
    initialize(){
        console.log(""testing"")
    }
    ```
  - How to link a JS file?
    - HTML file → add this attr `data-controller=""global--footer”`
    - JS file name -> `footer_controller.js`
  - How to target the element?
    - JS file → `static targets = [""target_name""]`
    - HTML file, on the targeted element → `<h1 data-global--footer-target=""target_name""></h1>`
  - To add event listener, i.e. click
    - HTML file, on the targeted element → `<h1 data-action=""click->global--footer#testClick""></h1>`
    - JS file → `testClick(){ this.testTarget.innerHTML = ""hello"" }`
- Kieran walked us how to create model in **ActiveRecord** by doing code-along together.
  - [Kieran’s note for reference](https://app.slack.com/docs/T0253B9P9/F057UEYUA93?origin_team=T0253B9P9 ""‌"").
  - `bin/rails g model` → this will not work but will generator a guide with example about how to run a correct command.
  - `bin/rails g model foo name:string age:integer active:boolean` → Created a `foo` model with column “name”, “age” and “active” and also 3 files in the rails project.
    - Go to `foo` file and add `null: false` next to `name` ensuring `name` field cannot be empty.
  - Check the status with `bin/rails db:migrate:status` and you will see a new migration as `down` in the list.
  - If you do `bin/rails db:migrate`, the status will change from `down` to `up`.
  - If you rollback `bin/rails db:rollback`, the status will change from `up` to `down`.
    - We can only do rollback when we making the changes actively.
  - If we try to create a Foo without a name, with just database
    constraints (e.g. `NOT NULL`) but without any model validations, we get database exceptions rather than ActiveRecord API-level validation errors.
    - The query/request will send to db but db realise name is null, got error, then send it back to us.
  - But once we added validations to `Foo` class, we get a much nicer validation interface on ruby land.
    - ```
      class Foo < ApplicationRecord
        validates :name, presence: true # also have absence, a bunch of other options
      end
      ```
  - Difference between `foo.save` & `foo.save!`
    - `foo.save` → return boolean
    - `foo.save` raise the exception.
  - `structure.sql` → this file in mixkit repo stores all the SQL queries.

- Straight into our card!
  - Trying to find the reason behind input and label for the headings
  - Mario helped with explaining where and why they live there.
    - The radio input is not displayed but the label is associated with the input tag with the “id” and “for” of the same attribute value
    - The chevron in mobile view is then able to expand based on radio behaviour
  - 1 option to make the radio button checked and unchecked is using JS (DOM)
    - Can write inline JS `<srcipt>` for testing first, then check with the team if they using any library for the components.
    - We can either change the input type to radio or checkbox.
      - If checkbox, need to figure out how to unchecked the others when 1 is being checked.
    - Then using JS (DOM) to override its native behaviour.
      - Target the `input` tag, add event handle `click`
      - When it’s being clicked, add `checked` attr.
      - When it’s being clicked again, remove `checked` attr.

  - Started Codecademy JS course
  - **Java VS Javascript**
    - Java for larger scale projects / enterprise
    - Longer initial startup time but easier to maintain
    - JS for virtually anything these days
    - Quicker initial startup but can be a bit more fiddly during maintenance

  - Did CodeWars - [Building Blocks](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55b75fcf67e558d3750000a3/train/ruby ""‌"") for OOP practice.
  - [Difference between object & class](https://trello.com/c/UFM2UNHA/49-difference-between-object-instance-class ""‌""):
    - Object - instance
    - Class - blueprint to create many instances that shared the same attributes & methods (data & behaviours)
  - [Object-relational mapping (ORM)](https://trello.com/c/xhF1M5mg/51-orm-object-relational-mapping ""‌"")
    - Interact with database using object & classes and without writing SQL query.
    - It maps info in database to object.
  - [What is ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails?](https://trello.com/c/u7jce32i/53-what-is-activerecord-in-ruby-on-rails ""‌"")

- Mobbing Session - [Algolia Analytics] Send client side analytics events
  - Try to track which object (video or photo) on the website that the user clicked after searched.
    - After the user clicked, it will send back the a list of info (in JSON) back to Algolia.
    - To enhance the searching experience for user.
- Active Record & Relational DB basics with Kieran
  - Files aren’t stored in the database, but any domain or business data (ecomm shop - inventory list of items) this is stored in the database.
  - Active Record is the M in MVC - MVC is the way of organising software (models, views, controllers)
  - Migration - A piece of code that takes the database from one version to another
  - New Migrations - create a new migration for anything new after pushed changes (for new or existing tables)
  - Rollback - for editing or mistakes while you are actively working on a migration. Once committed new migration will need to be added
- Pairing with Mario:
  - TDD - Roman numerals
    - Create a test for the other person and they have to adjust the code to make it pass
    - Refactoring :grimacing:

  - Tried to solve the roman numeral question by Mario.

## TIL

- Difference between Algolia & ElasticSearch
  - **Algolia** → it’s provider or company who have their own technology for search engine that is more powerful (than Elastic Search). They have different structure or “design” than ElasticSearch.
  - **ElasticSearch** → a library that you can import into your project.
- **Cookiebot** → a tool
  - Asking users for their consent what information we can track.

    - we should run lighthouse before and after
    - check what it flags and what our initial score is
    - there should be a check in mobile view for if a button is too small to be pressed on a phone, we should specifically check that (in the SEO test)

  - Social Hangout with Satellite team.
  - Continue with the Rails.
    - Still thinking about `resource`.
    - `link_to` helper → 2 argus
    - `new` & `create` actions are needed for CREATE.
  - Design pattern - MVC (Model, View, Controller)
    - Model → database. In rails, you can swap database with different database and it does not affect the Rails app works.
    - Views → web pages, HTML files
    - Controller → The brain of everything, where the routes sit.

- :apple: **adora** :apple:
  - Followed this [Rails lesson](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html ""‌"") building a simple blog.
  - To get smth render on the website, you need:
    - A route
    - A controller with an action (Ruby class & public methods are actions)
    - A view (template → ERB)
  - When an action does not explicitly render a view (or otherwise trigger an HTTP response), Rails will automatically render a view that matches the name of the controller and action.
  - You only need `require` calls for two use cases:
    - To load files under the `lib` directory.
    - To load gem dependencies that have `require: false` in the `Gemfile`.
  - ERB:
    - `<% %>` : Ruby code
    - `<%= %>` : Ruby code + output the returned value.
  - Route param: `:id`
    - e.g: `get '/articles/:id', to: 'articles#show'`
    - On show action: `@article = Article.find(params[:id])`

- **GTM (Google Tag Manager)**:
  - you can “tag” links in your html with specific information, then search for those tags in the GTM interface
  - Tag Manager gives you the ability to add and update your own tags for conversion tracking, site analytics, remarketing, and more. There are nearly endless ways to track activity across your sites and apps, and the intuitive design lets you change tags whenever you want.
- **breakpoint** = the sizes you use in your media queries

- Setting up Mixkit
  - Tangent onto TSO and what everyone owns and how much it all costs
- Satellites Induction:
  - **EPIC** - eg. make the mobile better - story is the steps to get to the epic - with acceptance criteria
    - once refined they can be added to backlog for prioritising into sprints
  - Satellite ceremonies - weekly meetings run throughs to keep on top of sprints
  - **SPRINT** runs for 2 weeks which you work on backlog items
  - **BACKLOG** is where you refine and find what needs to be prioritised for each sprint
- Satellites Refinement:
  - Refining the **EPIC** cards with stories to add into backlog
    - a card doesn’t usually go in Todo on the WIP (work in progress) board without being “refined” or “groomed” first
  - Adding things like story, product, estimate timelines, due dates
  - If there is anything that has been done or worked on that needs to be moved into the right area/board/card
  - **DONE WHEN** sets what the end goal is actually supposed to be
- Completing set up mixkit
  - issues with postgres - with the help of Dave :ambulance:  had to uninstall from brew and re-install as a global option
  - added ourselves to the commit-message-template in mixkit
    - worked on some merge conflicts with our PRs
    - Added our VERY FIRST PRs in Satellites :confetti_ball:

  - Always `git pull` & `./script/uptodate.sh` to make sure repo is updated.
  - `spec` folder → testing folder
  - `./script/test.sh` to run all the tests in the repo.
  - `./script/test.sh <file_name>` to run the test.
  - If you add `Serializer` at the end of the name, rail will associate the model and auto-serialise it.

👩‍👧‍👧 Pairing Session 👩‍👧‍👧

- VS Code Settings
  - Snippet
  - Command + p → `:` + line number you want to go.
- OOP
  - Class is blueprint or template to create object.
  - ```
    attr_reader :colour, :num_legs # only read
    attr_writer :colour, :num_legs # only edit
    attr_accessor :colour, :num_legs # read & edit
    ```
  - `:` - Symbol
  - Inheritance
    - ```
      # Dog class is child to Animal class
      class Dog < Animal
      ```
    - `super` will try to call the same name method that in the parents class.
  - Class Variable vs Instance Variable
  - Class Method vs Instance Method
  - `current_page` works too as it came from `:current_page` at `attr_reader` or other similar methods.
    ```ruby
    def move_bookmark
        @bookmarked_page = @current_page # or current_page
    end
    ```
- Mics info of Ruby
  - Sequence in Ruby code does matter.
  - Boolean method `?`, only return `true` or `false`

- 🍎 **ADORA** 🍎
  - Notes..
  - Read some info about Boolean method.

## What we did…

- Met with Ray! 🥟 Learned some more about Envato and about who Ray is!
- Continued pairing:
  - Working through ruby making an Emoji file and a counter
- People team induction
- Demi:
  - Read up on REST API - A request response process for data and information collecting.
- 🍎 **ADORA** 🍎
  - Tidied up notes: organised what I have learned today:
    - How to read a the **whole file** - read method: `file.read`
    - Create hash - `Hash.new`, to set key & value - same as Python
    - The below are the same:
    - ```ruby
      # ignore the f variable.
      a.each do |element|
      	f.puts(element)
      end

      # vs
      a.each{ |element| f.puts(element) }
      ```
    - Check a key is existed in hash - `hash.key?(key_value)`
    - Delete a key in hash - `hash.delete(key)`
    - How to get user input - `gets.chomp`
  - Read Diff between `print`, `puts` and `p` (link [here](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/10/puts-vs-print/ ""‌"")):
    - `print`: same line, can print the array
    - `puts`: linebreak, will convert the array to string & skip `nil` element (print nothing). It does not impact hash tho…🤔
    - `p`: mainly for debugging, will show invisible character 🔎 Also different when you put `p` & `puts` in a function. `p` will act similar like `return` whereas `puts` will return nothing (nil).
  - Did some practice on writing simple code to practice the new Ruby code/method I learned from pairing today.

## To do tomorrow…

- 🍎 ADORA 🍎
  - Ruby:
    - How to loop strings, array, hash in Ruby.
